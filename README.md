# Declarative D3 With React

This project was largely inspired by:

https://bl.ocks.org/shimizu/7b198ba0dd29ccbba60c35a8b2d33160

The motivation for this project is to find a way to easily build interactive charts within the React ecosystem.

This project is built off of my starter project found here:
